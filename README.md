## Description

Implemented an object detection system for Autonomous vehicles using OpenCV and Darknet. I have used the pre-trained YOLOv3 model, one of the most powerful and fastest deep neural networks (106 layers) in computer vision. It's not feasible to run the model in a CPU so, leveraged the Google colab to run the model using Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU, which is 34 times faster than using a CPU. The system is capable of detecting 80 classes however, my main focus is to detect vehicles on road, signals, signs, and pedestrians. The algorithm is pretty accurate and detected all the expected classes along with the bounding boxes and confidence percentage on a test traffic video.
